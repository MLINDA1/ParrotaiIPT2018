In this ending week i had covered the following based on the recommendation systems
# The genaral concept of the recomendation system
Recommender systems identify recommendations autonomously for 
individual users based on past purchases and searches, and on other users' behavior
# Basic approaches
Where most recommender systems take either of two basic approaches:   
- collaborative filtering 
- content-based filtering
But there are other approaches such as hybrid approaches that are applied too.
Now let us look at the two above just in a very brief way:
# Collaborative filtering
This arrives at a recommendation that's based on a model of prior user behavior.
For example, suppose you're building a website to recommend blogs.
By using the information from many users who subscribe to and read blogs,
you can group those users based on their preferences.
# Content-based filtering
This constructs a recommendation on the basis of a user's behavior
For example, this approach might use historical browsing information,
such as which blogs the user reads and the characteristics of those blogs.
And for the case of Hybrids, this combine collaborative and content-based filtering which increasing the efficiency (and complexity)
of recommender systems.
# THE ALGORITHMS THAT RECOMENDATION SYSTEMS USE
Many algorithmic approaches are available for recommendation engines.
Results can differ based on the problem the algorithm is designed to solve or the relationships that are present in the data.
Here are few that i have been passing through
* Pearson correlation
* Clustering algorithms  
And others are(That i am not yet good at)
* Bayesian Belief Nets
* Markov chains
* Rocchio classification
